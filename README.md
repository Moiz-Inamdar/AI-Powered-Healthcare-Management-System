# AI-Powered-Healthcare-Management-System

"The idea for this project came from a real-life situation I observed at a newly opened medical store. The store personnel struggled to read and understand the doctors' handwritten prescriptions, leading to delays and confusion in issuing the right medicines. This inspired me to build a system that could streamline the interaction between doctors and medical store staff.

Initially, my plan was to develop a simple system that included only the doctor and medical store roles. Doctors could register patients and prescribe medicines, and the store staff could view and issue those medicines efficiently.

However, as part of your task requirement, we were also encouraged to integrate AI into our solution. This made me expand the project by including a patient role with AI-powered features. Now, patients can not only view their medical history but also:

Get AI-powered doctor recommendations based on their symptoms.

Use an AI health chatbot for basic medical advice.

Understand their prescribed medicines using natural language explanations from Hugging Face AI.

This evolution made the project more complete, intelligent, and user-friendly for all three key users: doctor, patient, and pharmacist."
